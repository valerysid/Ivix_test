# Usage

`scrapy crawl yelp -a category=Contractors -a location='San Francisco' -o result.csv`

# Description

The purpose is to develop a yelp crawler that scraps all the businesses from Yelp website.

# Requirements:

The crawler should be given as an input:

1. Category name, ie - contractors
2. Location, ie - San Francisco, CA
   The crawler should return a file with json objects, each json representing a business from the
   given search results. Each business should have the following data:

- Business name
- Business rating
- Number of reviews
- Business yelp url
- Business website

List of first 5 reviews, for each review:

- Reviewer name
- Reviewer location

- Review date

Some notes:

- Using scrapy - an advantage but not a MUST
- Pay attention to which data you can get via XHR request (direct json api) and which data
  you need to parse html
- You should build a solution that CAN get ALL the businesses, not some, even though
  you don't need to actually run on all, just a sample to demonstrate that it works.
